## Where does it dump to?
- C:\GMOD-Dumper\

## How do I inject?
- Use any injector you want, as long as its x64 (Only tested with Xenos)

## How do I build it?
- Personally, I've used CLion. If you don't have this, either:
  - go to "Releases" tab
  - Build it yourself with either CLion or Visual Studio 2022 w/ CMake
